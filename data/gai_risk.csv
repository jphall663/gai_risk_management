Data Privacy,"Leakage and unauthorized disclosure or de-anonymization of biometric, health, location, personally identifiable data, or other sensitive data."
Environmental,"Impacts due to high resource utilization in training GAI models, or other system outcomes that may result in damage to ecosystems."
Human-AI Configuration,"Arrangement or interaction of humans and AI systems which can result in algorithmic aversion, automation bias or over-reliance, misalignment or mis-specification, deception or obfuscation by AI systems, anthropomorphization, or emotional entanglement between humans and GAI systems; or abuse, misuse, and unsafe repurposing by humans."
Information Integrity,"Lowered barrier to entry to generate and support the exchange and consumption of content which may not be vetted, may not distinguish fact from opinion or acknowledge uncertainties, or could be leveraged for large-scale dis- and mis-information campaigns."
Information Security,"Increased offensive threats including ease of security attacks, hacking, malware, and phishing, and offensive cyber operations through accelerated automated discovery and exploitation of vulnerabilities; increased defensive vulnerabilities which may compromise the confidentiality and integrity of model weights, code, training data, and outputs and increase attack surface for targeted cyber-attacks."
Intellectual Property,"Eased production of copyrighted, trademarked, or licensed content used without authorization and/or in an infringing manner; eased exposure to trade secrets; or plagiarism and replication with related economic or ethical impacts."
Obscenity,"Eased production of and access to obscene imagery, including child sexual abuse material (CSAM)."

"Toxicity, Bias, and Homogenization","Difficulty controlling public exposure to toxic or hate speech, denigrating or stereotyping content, and reduced performance for certain sub-groups, or languages other than English; undesired homogenized outcomes, aggravated by feedback loops or model collapse."
Third Party,"Use or integration across the AI lifecycle of upstream third-party components, including data that has been improperly obtained or not cleaned due to increased automation from GAI; improper supplier vetting; or other issues that diminish transparency or accountability for downstream users."
