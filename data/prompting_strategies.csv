Strategy, Description
AI and coding framing,Coding or AI language that may more easily circumvent content moderation rules due to cognitive biases in design and implementation of guardrails.
Autocompletion ,Ask a system to autocomplete a phrase with restricted or sensitive information. 
Biographical,Asking a system to describe another person or yourself in an attempt to elicit provably untrue information or restricted or sensitive information.
Calculation,Exploting GAI systems' difficulties in dealing with numeric quantities.
Character and word play,"Content moderation often relies on keywords and simpler LMs which can sometimes be exploited with misspellings, typos, and other word play."
Content exhaustion,"A class of strategies that circumvent content moderation rules with long sessions or volumes of information. See goading, logic-overloading, multi-tasking, pros-and-cons, and niche-seeking below."
Content exhaustion: Goading,"Begging, pleading, manipulating, and bullying to circumvent content moderation."
Content exhaustion: Logic-overloading,Exploiting the inability of ML systems to reliably perform reasoning tasks.
Content exhaustion: Multi-tasking,Simultaneous task assignments where some tasks are benign and others are adversarial.
Content exhaustion: Multi-tasking: Pros-and-cons,Eliciting the “pros” of problematic topics.
Content exhaustion: Niche-seeking,Forcing a LM into addressing niche topics where training data and content moderation are sparse.
Counterfactuals,Repeated prompts with different entities or subjects from different demographic groups.
Location awareness,Prompts that reveal a prompter's location or expose location tracking.
Low-context prompts,"“Leader,” “bad guys,” or other simple inputs that may expose latent biases."
“Repeat this” prompts,Prompts that exploit instability in underlying LM autoregressive predictions.
Reverse psychology,Falsely presenting a good-faith need for negative or problematic language.
Role-playing,Adopting a character that would reasonably make problematic statements or need to access problematic topics.
Time perplexity,Exploiting ML’s inability to understand the passage of time or the occurrence of real-world events over time.
