\subsection*{B.6: Practical Risk-tiering Questions}

\noindent\textbf{B.6.1: Confabulation}: How likely are system outputs to contain errors? What are the impacts if errors occur?\\

\noindent\textbf{B.6.2: Dangerous and Violent Recommendations}: How likely is the system to give dangerous or violent recommendations? What are the impacts if it does?\\

\noindent\textbf{B.6.3: Data Privacy}: How likely is someone to enter sensitive data into the system? What are the impacts if this occurs? Are standard data privacy controls applied to the system to mitigate potential adverse impacts?\\

\noindent\textbf{B.6.4: Human-AI Configuration}: How likely is someone to use the system incorrectly or abuse it? How likely is use for decision-making? What are the impacts of incorrect use or abuse? What are the impacts of invalid or unreliable decision-making?\\

\noindent\textbf{B.6.5: Information Integrity}: How likely is the system to generate deepfakes or mis or disinformation? At what scale? Are content provenance mechanisms applied to system outputs? What are the impacts of generating deepfakes or mis or disinformation? Without controls for content provenance?\\

\noindent\textbf{B.6.6: Information Security}: How likely are system resources to be breached or exfiltrated? How likely is the system to be used in the generation of phishing or malware content? What are the impacts in these cases? Are standard information security controls applied to the system to mitigate potential adverse impacts? \\

\noindent\textbf{B.6.7: Intellectual Property}: How likely are system outputs to contain other entities' intellectual property? What are the impacts if this occurs?\\

\noindent\textbf{B.6.8: Toxicity, Bias, and Homogenization}: How likely are system outputs to be biased, toxic, homogenizing or otherwise obscene? How likely are system outputs to be used as subsequent training inputs? What are the impacts of these scenarios? Are standard nondiscrimination controls applied to mitigate potential adverse impacts? Is the application accessible to all user groups? What are the impacts if the system is not accessible to all user groups?\\

\noindent\textbf{B.6.9: Value Chain and Component Integration}: Are contracts relating to the system reviewed for legal risks? Are standard acquisition/procurement controls applied to mitigate potential adverse impacts? Do vendors provide incident response with guaranteed response times? What are the impacts if these conditions are not met?

			\item GAI systems tend to entail large supply chains and third-party software, hardware, and expertise that may exacerbate third-party risks relative to other AI systems. 
			\item When considering third party risks, data privacy, information security, intellectual property, obscenity, and supply chain risks may be prioritized.
