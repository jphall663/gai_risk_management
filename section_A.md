**Table A.1:** Trustworthy Characteristic to Generative AI Risk Crosswalk.

**Usage Note**: Table A.1 provides an example of mapping GAI risks onto AI RMF trustworthy characteristics. Mapping GAI risks to AI RMF trustworthy characteristics can be particularly useful when existing policies, processes, or controls can be applied to manage GAI risks, but have been previously implemented in alignment with the AI RMF trustworthy characteristics. Many mappings are possible. Mappings that differ from the example may be more appropriate to meet a particular organization's risk management goals.

**Table A.2:** Generative AI Risk to Trustworthy Characteristic Crosswalk.

**Usage Note**: Table A.2 provides an example of mapping AI RMF trustworthy characteristics onto GAI risks. Mapping AI RMF trustworthy characteristics to GAI risks can assist organizations in aligning GAI guidance to existing AI/ML policies, processes, or controls or to extend GAI guidance to address additional AI/ML technologies. Many mappings are possible. Mappings that differ from the example may be more appropriate to meet a particular organization's risk management goals.
