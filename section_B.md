**Usage Note**: Materials in Appendix B can be used to create or update
risk tiers or other risk assessment tools for GAI systems or
applications as follows:

-   Table B.1 can enable mapping of GAI risks and impacts.

-   Table B.2 can enable quantification of impacts for risk tiering or
    risk assessment.

-   Table B.3 can enable quantification of likelihood for risk tiering
    or risk assessment.

-   Table B.4 presents an example of combining assessed impact and
    likelihood into risk tiers.

-   Table B.5 presents example risk tiers with associated qualitative,
    semi-quantitative, and quantitative values for risk tiering or risk
    assessment.

-   Subsection B.6 presents example questions for qualitative risk
    assessment.

-   Subsection B.7 highlights subcategories to indicate alignment with
